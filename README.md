wordamentsolve
==============

This is a solver for Wordament from Microsoft written in python. 
I plan to add options to enable it to solve similar games like Ruzzle.
I'm a newbie, so please feel free to point out any mistakes I might have made.

I've heard that cheating leads to bans from the leaderboards, so please use this sparingly :D
